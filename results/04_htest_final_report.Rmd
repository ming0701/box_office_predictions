```{r setuphtest, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

library(knitr)

```{r load test results, echo=FALSE}

```

## Analysis

To answer our question, we will perform a hypothesis testing. First, we'll define $H_0$ and $H_A$ as below:

$H_0:$ the proportion of athletes under 25 that win a medal is equal to the proportion of athletes 25 and older that win a medal.

$H_A:$ the proportion of athletes under 25 that win a medal is greater to the proportion of athletes 25 and older that win a medal.

We will then

1. Compute the observed test statistic from original sample,

2. Use the null model to generate 100 random permuted samples from the original sample and calculate their corresponding r test statistics,

3. Generate the null distribution using these r test statistics,

4. Check if the observed test statistic computed in (1) falls on the distribution,

5. Calculate the p-value to verify the result

The code used to perform the analysis and create this report can be found here: [https://github.com/UBC-MDS/olympic_medal_htest](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/olympic_medal_htest/)

## Results & Discussion

```{r summaryhtest, echo=FALSE}
kable(summary, caption = "Table 3. Data summary") |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

We can see from the table above that there are 131,134 athletes under age of 25 and 13.68% of them got a medal in the event, while there are 130,508 athletes equal to or above the age of 25 and 16.18% of them got a medal in the event.

```{r testing-result, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 5. Hypothesis testing result", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/04_h0_dist.png")
```

After generating the null distribution, and placing our observed test statistic on the plot in figure 5, we can see that the observed test statistics (red line) falls within the significance threshold (blue line), therefore we fail to reject $H_0$.

```{r p_value result, echo=FALSE}
kable(p_value, caption = "Table 4. p-value for the test.", col.names = 'p-value') |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

The test statistic is -0.025, which is the portion of medal athletes under 25 minus the portion of medal athletes equal to or above 25. It is far outside the null distribution in the graph as our alternative hypothesis is "the proportion of medal athletes under 25 is greater than the proportion of medal athletes equal to or above 25", but the test statistic suggests that the portion of medal athletes under 25 is less than the portion of medal athletes equal to or above 25. This is a complete reverse of the alternative hypothesis.

The p-value calculated is 1 and it is higher than the $\alpha$ of 0.05. It leads us to the same conclusion:

We fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that it is not statistically significant that the proportion of athletes younger than 25 that win a medal is greater than the proportion of athletes of age 25 or older that win a medal.
